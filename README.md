![Alt text](SuperBizzleRPG/images/ExampleImage.png?raw=true "Example Image")

## To build the application you'll need:
Access to the .net WindowsForms library, and an IDE.
The solution is fairly simple, seperated into 2 parts:

### Engine
- Holds the blueprints of things such as Items, Vendors, Weapons and such
- Holds the content of the game in the _\_World.cs_ file

### VanaDiel
- Holds the Trading and MainWindow screen logic
- Controls the operations and logic of the main game
